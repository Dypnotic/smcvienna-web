	<h1>Catechism</h1>
	<section>
		<p>
			SMC Catechism classes are conducted to give formation in the Catholic
			faith to the children of our Parish. It's a divine opportunity for our
			children to have religious education in our Malayalee tradition and
			culture.
		</p>
		<p>
			The classes are available in 8 levels suitable for children up to 8th
			grade (below 14 years old) and meet every Sunday throughout the year at
			following places.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meidling: <em>10:45 hrs</em> (Pfarre Maria Lourdes, Tivoligasse 20, 1120 Vienna)
			<br />
			Saikogasse: <em>16:15 hrs</em> (Pfarre Auferstehung Christi, Saikogasse 8,
			1220 Vienna)
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Catechism classes Established in the year 2001 with 15 children in
			Stadlau SMZ Chappell. Year to year the number of children were increasing
			enormously. Due to space allocation problem for dividing the children in
			different classes, we had to find out other facilities. In 2003 we moved
			to the Satadlau church and we were allowed to use the entire basement area
			for catechism classes. We started Catechism classes at the same time in
			Meidling church also.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2005 September we follow the Catechism lessons based on the text
			published by The Synodal Commission for Catechesis, Syro-Malabar
			Catechetical Centre, Cochin. Now we have 243 catechism students in both
			units together and 16 teachers and 2 reserve teachers. We have set up an
			orientation program for the grown up children of our Community in the
			academic year 2007 - 2008. Every year we plan study tours for grown up
			children.
		</p>
		<p>
			We started the 8th Level class in 2010 including the chapters for class
			8.9 and 10. The winners of Final level will be awarded the <em>
				primary catechetical education certificate
			</em> from the Diocese.
		</p>
		<p>
			The catechism classes begin with a common prayer of children in the church
			and move to their own classes. We have introduced semester examinations in
			January and in June 2007. The mark list of each examination will be
			published in both centers. As a motivation to the children they will be
			awarded First and Second Prizes for highest mark and maximum attendance as
			Certificates on the first day of the new academic year. One day Teachers
			seminar has introduced in March 2010 and planned to continue every year.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are very thankful to Fr. Dr.Thomas Thandapally CST, ICC Chaplain, and
			our Assistant Chaplain Fr. Joy Plathottathil SVD for their great
			leadership and advises to this institution. I am very proud to express my
			gratitude to all our teachers for their sincere dedication and sacrifice
			to our young generation for their spiritual awareness and growth. Since
			2010-11 Academic year, we gave chances to Youth Teachers to teach
			catechism in both centers.
