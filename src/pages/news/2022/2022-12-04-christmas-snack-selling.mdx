Dear family and friends,

As announced, this year's Christmas Carol Singing Competition will be happening next Sunday. We are happy to let you know that we, the SMC Youth Team, will also be an active part of it as we will be distributing snacks and beverages on the SMC Christmas Carol Day.

Date and Time: <em>Sunday, 11th December 3:30pm onwards</em>

Venue: <em>Maria Lourdes Church in Meidling.</em>

It would be great if our SMC families could prepare some snacks on this occasion. If you wish to contribute, please write your name on the list which can be found on the noticeboards at Saikogasse and at the Maria Lourdes Church! You can also contact one of the SMC Youth Core members.

Simply prepare your special snack that can range from cutlets to delicious samosas or fluffy vattayappams to puffs and deliver it to the SMC Youth Team. The earnings raised on this day will be used to finance the Ruby Jubilee Charity Initiative.

Thank you very much for your support and help in advance üôèüèΩ‚ù§!

We are looking forward to celebrate the beautiful day of Carol Singing with delicious snacks and comforting drinks!
Your support means a lot to us! Let‚Äôs make it happen by supporting each other!

Yours,
SMC Youth Team
