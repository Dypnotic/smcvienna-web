Dear Friends,

Archbishop Joseph Powathil, Emeritus of Changanacherry Syro-Malabar Archeparchy, passed away on 18 March 2023 at the age of 92. He served as a priest for 60 years and a bishop for 51 years, and was known for his work in preserving and developing the oriental liturgical, theological, and spiritual heritage of the Syro Malabar Church. He was also committed to education and interfaith dialogue, and will be greatly missed.

With sorrow,

Syro Malabar Community Vienna
