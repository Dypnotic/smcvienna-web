Greetings and welcome to the movie night on the 16th of November, 2023 at 6:00pm, which we are hosting with Dialog:Abraham, an interreligious group! 

After viewing a movie about an ecumenical subject, we'll have snack and juice, while discussing about it. 

Abraham is an interfaith student group that meets frequently to talk about spiritual issues. Hearty Welcome, everyone!
