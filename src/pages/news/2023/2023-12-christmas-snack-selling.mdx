Dear family and friends,

We're excited to share that the Christmas Carol Singing Competition is just around the corner on Sunday, December 10th, starting at 3:45 pm at Maria Lourdes Church in Meidling. The SMYM Team Vienna is thrilled to be part of this festive event, where we'll be providing snacks and beverages.

We encourage our SMC families to contribute by preparing special snacksâ€”whether it's cutlets, samosas, vattayappams, or puffs. Please inform a member of the core team from SMYM if you'd like to contribute. Your delicious creations will not only add to the joy of the day but also help raise funds for various activities and events organized by the SMYM Team Vienna.

We appreciate your support and look forward to celebrating the joyous day of Carol Singing with your tasty snacks and refreshing drinks!

Warm regards,

SMYM Team Vienna
