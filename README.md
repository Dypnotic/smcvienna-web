## ðŸ“š Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€assets/
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€â”€ All important assets (to be kept at a minimum)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ All components (preferably in Svelte)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ All pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style/
â”‚   		â””â”€â”€ Base Styles (component styles are within the component file)
â””â”€â”€ Config files
```

Astro looks for `.astro`, `mdx` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
